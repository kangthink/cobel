# Cobel

ðŸ—¼Babel tower of coding. Every programming language is explained with simple code snippet for novice programmers. This will help novice programmers to understand common concepts across the languages.


# Structure

The whole structure of this project focuses on showing common concepts across programming languages. Even though there are language specific concepts, we can categorize prgramming language concepts following some convention. This convention is easily seen at official documentations of programming languages. Major concepts are below:

- Basics
- Datatypes
- Operators
- Control Flow
- Functions
- Classes (Objects, Prototpye, ...)
  - Properties
  - Methods
- OOP
- Module (package, framework, ...)
- Error
- Access Control
